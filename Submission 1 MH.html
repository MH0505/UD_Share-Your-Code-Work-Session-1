    <h2> Intro to the Web </h2>
    <p>
      The Web is essentially a collection of HTML files that are linked together via so called Hyperlinks. An HTML file ("Hypertext Markup Language") is the main document type on the web, comparable to MS office products on Microsoft.

    <h2> The World Wide Web: Components </h2> The key components of the Web as displayed in the picture set forth below are
    <ul>
      <li><b>the browser</b> on my computer, which is the gateway to the internet; i.e. a program displaying files on the web; </li>
      <li><b>the internet</b>, which is a large computer network; </li>
      <li><b>the HTTP protocol</b> ("Hypertext Transport Protocol"), i.e. a set of rules managing the communication between the browser and the server to display the appropriate HTML files; </li>
      <li><b>the server</b>, which is a computer hosting the HTML files that make up the web </li>
    </ul>

      <em>  question: why shall I not use the "div" instead of the "p" tag to display the picture? </em>

      In other words, if I would like to read the Udacity webpage, I type in the corresponding web page address ("URL", Uniform Resource Locator) into my browser, which sends a request via the internet to the server, where the Udacity HTML files are hosted.
      The request is transmitted by using the HTTP protocol, enabling the communication between my browser and the Udacity server. The HTML file I am looking for at the Udacity page is then displayed on my computer by using the browser (in my case Google
      Chrome)

    <h2> Notes on HTML </h2> HTML is made up of

    <ul>
      <li><b> text content </b>"the plain text that one will ultimately see"; ""</li>
      <li><b> markup language </b>"tags that will style text and video content ";</li>
      <li><b> references </b>to videos and pictures; </li>
      <li><b> links </b>to other webpages; </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <H3> Markup Language, i.e. "tags" </h3> Markup language consists of tags that alter the appearance of what is "seen" on the actual website. Tags consist of opening tags
    <Name> and closing tags </Name>
    with content in between, together called "element" <br>
    <br> Set forth below are various tags that were part of the course. Further tags can be found on websites such as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com"> W3Schools.com </a> <br>

    <ul>
      <li>The tag <b> "b" writes contents in bold </b> and is an inline element </li>
      <li> The tag <em> "em" writes contents in italics </em> and is an inline element</li>
      <li>The tag "br" inserts a line break and is an inline element</li>
      <li>The tag "a href " references to other websites, i.e. defines a hyperlink and is an inline element</li>
      <li> The tag "img" <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTyd7Ub_hHIYscOa8t-aVuHk1Kd6_Ll3QR-vcS9EKVcOIeHv5OtEA" alt="Sunglass Smiley" height="50" width="50"> inserts an image by using a link and is an inline element </li>
      <li> The tag "p" is a paragraph and is a block element, i.e. puts a box around the contents inside the tag</li>
      <li> The element "span" is an inline element and needed to "style with CSS" </li>
      <li>The element "div" is a block element and needed to "style with CSS" </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <h2> Basics on HTML document structures </h2> HTML documents are structure into the following parts
    <ul>
      <li> Doctype definition, which is typically HTML 5</li>
      <li> An HTML tag / element </li>
      <li> a header tag containing title, CSS information and other metadata</li>
      <li>the body tag, which is the main focus of this course</li>
    </ul>
    Indentation is one important thing to remember when writing an HTML documentdocument. "The indentation level increases when an idea begins and decreases when an idea is finished". It is thereby easier to structure and review the document
